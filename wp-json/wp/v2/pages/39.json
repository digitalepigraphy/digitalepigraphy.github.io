The group made its first public appearance in the <a href=\"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/digitalepigraphy.org\/page\/application-of-3d-technologies-for-the-analysis-of-ancient-inscriptions\/\">2007 International Congress of Greek and Latin Epigraphy at the University of Oxford, where our presentation was enthusiastically received by the international community and was considered a breakthrough for that time.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, our preliminary results were published in the <a href=\"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/digitalepigraphy.org\/page\/a-novel-framework-for-3d-reconstruction-and-analysis-of-ancient-inscriptions-2\/\">Journal of Machine Vision and Applications<\/a>, in which we proposed a novel cost-effective method for 3D digitization of epigraphic squeezes based on the shape-from-shading method.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011 the DEA project was awarded a <a href=\"https:\/\/securegrants.neh.gov\/publicquery\/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=HD-51214-11\">grant by the National Endowment for the Humanities<\/a> for the implementation of our shape-from-shading method and the development of a graphical interface that includes user-friendly options for 3D visualization of inscriptions, and 3D navigation, among other features. For the dissemination of the toolbox produced from this award we established the website <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalepigraphy.org\/\">digitalepigraphy.org<\/a>, which later became a key reference for epigraphists with interest in 3D digitization and dissemination of paper casts of inscriptions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology project has attracted attention from other institutions that led to collaborative publications and digitization projects with the University of Milan, Cornell University, University of California Berkeley, University of Lyon 2, Ca\u2019 Foscari University of Venice, Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences, Library of Congress, UK National Archives, the British Museum, Tampa Museum of Art, Palazzo Altemps in Rome, and other institutes around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have presented the results of the aforementioned collaborative digitization projects in nationally- and internationally-acclaimed conferences, such as the 104th American Institute of Archaeology Annual Meeting, the 13th Congress of Greek and Latin Epigraphy hosted by Oxford University, the 14th Congress of Greek and Latin Epigraphy hosted by Humboldt University, the Digital Humanities Seminar Series at the University of Leipzig, the 15th Congress of Greek and Latin Epigraphy hosted by the University of Vienna, the London Digital Classicist Seminar Series, the Berlin Digital Classicist Seminar Series, and the 16th Congress of Greek and Latin Epigraphy hosted by the Universities in Bordeaux . Our team was also awarded the second place in the international competition for the e-humanities innovation award organized by the University of Leipzig.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate goal of the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology group is to set advanced technologies to the service and promotion of the Humanities and bridge gaps in collaborative and interdisciplinary research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Project Administration<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Angelos Barmpoutis, Ph.D.<\/strong><br>Director of the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology project<br>Digital Worlds Institute, University of Florida<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eleni Bozia, Ph.D.<\/strong><br>Associate Director of the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology project<br>Department of Classics, University of Florida<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Contributors and Collaborators<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Miriam Amin<\/strong><br>The Digital Rosetta Stone project at the University of Leipzig and co-author<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Claudia&nbsp;Antonetti, Ph.D.<\/strong><br>The Venice Squeeze project<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Monica Berti, Ph.D.<\/strong><br>The Digital Rosetta Stone project at the University of Leipzig and co-author<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mich\u00e8le Brunet, Ph.D.<\/strong><br>The E-STAMPAGES digitization project at the Universit\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re Lyon 2<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bruno Dede Jr. <\/strong>(Class of 2024)<br>Image registration tool for Shape-from-Shading and SVG JavaScript library.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dinah Eastop, Ph.D.<\/strong><br>UK National Archives digitization project and co-author<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rachel Farmer, Ph.D.<\/strong><br>UK National Archives digitization project and co-author<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Danielle Fortuna, Ph.D.<\/strong><br>The Altemps Museum in Rome digitization project and co-author<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rhea Garen<\/strong><br>The Monumentum Ancyranum digitization project at Cornell University<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josephine Hensel<\/strong><br>The Digital Rosetta Stone project at the University of Leipzig and co-author<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adeline Levivier, Ph.D.<\/strong><br>The E-STAMPAGES digitization project at the Universit\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re Lyon 2<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Franziska Naether, Ph.D.<\/strong><br>The Digital Rosetta Stone project at the University of Leipzig and co-author<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Seth Pevnick, Ph.D.<\/strong><br>The Sphageion digitization project at the Tampa Museum of Art<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Rebillard, Ph.D.<\/strong><br>The Monumentum Ancyranum digitization project at Cornell University<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jacob R.
