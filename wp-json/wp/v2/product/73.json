According to Prof. Barmpoutis (University of Florida) &#8220;this is an exemplar case that demonstrates the capabilities of 3D digitized models compared to the original 2D images. It is truly remarkable how much more inscribed details can be seen in the depthmap computed by the SFS method, using just a conventional office paper scanner. When I first saw the scanned squeeze I was convinced that there was no inscription survived in this fragment, but when I saw the reconstruction results I could clearly recognize several letters despite the fact that I am not a professional epigraphist myself.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-74\" src=\"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/digitalepigraphy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Demo_Image3_small-300x194.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.digitalepigraphy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Demo_Image3_small-300x194.png 300w, https:\/\/www.digitalepigraphy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Demo_Image3_small-1024x663.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.digitalepigraphy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Demo_Image3_small-768x497.png 768w, https:\/\/www.digitalepigraphy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Demo_Image3_small-600x389.png 600w, https:\/\/www.digitalepigraphy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Demo_Image3_small.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><br \/>\n<span class=\"nrml\"><b>Figure 3.<\/b> Left: One of the original scanned images of a squeeze from a severely weathered inscription.
