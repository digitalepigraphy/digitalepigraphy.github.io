Although found in different locations, these inscriptions show close affinities in content (sacred poetry), material (red local limestone) and writing (uncial lettering of the third century CE). The 3D reconstruction of the letterforms provides us with definite proof that all of them came from the same monument, possibly an inscribed wall from one of the buildings in the sanctuary&#8217;s main area. A closer observation of the results reveals even some minor groups of letters with similar construction, which validates the accuracy of the proposed method. The advantages of 3D reconstruction in epigraphical research are especially obvious in the case of badly weathered or damaged inscribed surfaces, where the lettering is difficult to discern with the naked eye.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this paper we propose a novel method for 3D reconstruction of inscriptions using a shape-from-shading technique and for statistical analysis of their reconstructed surfaces using images of scanned squeezes.
