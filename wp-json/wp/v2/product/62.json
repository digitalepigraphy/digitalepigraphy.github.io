Each session lasted for about 180 seconds and captured several millions of polygons on the surface of each statue.<\/span><\/center>This process produced a dataset of 3D digitized statues with 3D point accuracy in the range of millimeters. In addition, a skeleton fitting process calculated the location of 20 major joints in the body of each statue. The goal of this project was to use the skeletal information of the statues in order to study the pose variations of the statues, calculate affinities or differences between statues, and perform keyword-free database search.<\/p>\n<p><center><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-63\" src=\"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/digitalepigraphy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/3d_statues-300x76.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"76\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.digitalepigraphy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/3d_statues-300x76.png 300w, https:\/\/www.digitalepigraphy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/3d_statues.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><br \/>\n<span class=\"nrml\">This figure shows selected samples from our dataset of 3D digitized statues.<\/span><\/center>Digital technologies have been adopted in various areas related to museum experience, digital preservation, as well as digitization and study of archaeological artifacts. Digital collections become even more useful educationally and scientifically when they provide tools for searching through the collection and analyzing, comparing, and studying their records. For example an image collection becomes powerful if it can be searched by content, technique, pattern, color, or even similarity with a sample image. The lack of keywords and generalizable annotation for such type of analysis generates the need for keyword-free feature-based analysis.<\/p>\n<p><center><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-65\" src=\"https:\/\/research.dwi.ufl.edu\/projects\/digitalepigraphy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/skeletons_3views-300x147.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"147\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.digitalepigraphy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/skeletons_3views-300x147.png 300w, https:\/\/www.digitalepigraphy.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/skeletons_3views.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><br \/>\n<span class=\"nrml\">Visualization of the estimated skeletons of statues in our dataset shown from three different perspectives. Quantitative posture analysis can be applied to such dataset in order to assist scholars in studying the variations between sculptures from different cultures, eras, and schools.<\/span><\/center>The DEA group has designed a framework in which each statue is represented in a feature space based on the skeletal geometry of the human body. A distance function is defined in the feature space and is employed in order to find statues with similarities in their pose. The search query in the presented framework is the body of the user, who can interact with the system and find which statues have poses similar to the user&#8217;s pose. The framework will be presented in the 17th International Confrence on Human-Computer Interaction to be held in Los Angeles, in August 2015.<\/p>\n<p><center><br \/>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.digitalepigraphy.org\/legacy\/view?object=statue5\" width=\"600px\" height=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><br \/>\n<span class=\"nrml\">Above you can find an example of an embedded 3D sculpture from the digitized collection.

It has the potential to be used as a scientific tool for assisting scholars in identifying statues with similar characteristics from a large repository of statues, but also as an interactive guide in museums. The future use of depth sensors in mobile devices will significantly support the creation of such repositories of 3D digitized artifacts, using limited resources (in terms of scanning time, computational effort, and cost) as well as their computer-assisted study as demonstrated in detail in the published article by Barmpoutis et al<sup><a href=\"#ref2\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">2<\/span><\/a><\/sup>.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more on how to use our open-access tools to digitize, analyze, and disseminate your own collection feel free to contact us or visit the web-site of the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology project.<\/p>\n<p>The DEA editorial team<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>References:<\/b><br \/>\n<a name=\"ref1\"><\/a><br \/>\n1.
