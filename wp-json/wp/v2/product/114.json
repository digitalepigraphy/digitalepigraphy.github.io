It allows epigraphists to digitize in 3D their epigraphic squeezes using our novel cost-effective technique, which overcomes the limitations of the current methods for digitizing epigraphic data in 2-dimensions only. Our toolbox contains several options for 3D visualization of inscriptions, as well as a set of scientific tools for analyzing the lettering techniques and performing quantitative analysis of the letterform variations. Furthermore, the users have the option to share their data, as well as search other uploaded collections of 3D inscriptions in a semi-supervised dynamic library. This dynamic library is organized thematically according to language, area of origin, and date and contains a comprehensive record of the inscription in the form of plain text, 3D model, 2D photographs, and other epigraphic information.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WUd333VdgCk?feature=oembed\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In our presentation we intend to introduce the Digital Epigraphy Toolbox which is a crossplatform web-application designed to facilitate the digital preservation, study, and electronic dissemination of ancient inscriptions.
