<p>BERLIN, Germany<br />
February 15, 2022</p>
<p>Our interdisciplinary team is happy to present today in Berlin&#8217;s Digital Classicist Seminar series the new on-line tool for 3D reconstruction of epigraphic squeezes using our shape-from-shading technique (<a href="https://research.dwi.ufl.edu/projects/digitalepigraphy.org/page/a-novel-framework-for-3d-reconstruction-and-analysis-of-ancient-inscriptions-2/">MVA 2010</a>). The new tool that replaces our older Digital Epigraphy Toolbox can be accessed in the following address:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalepigraphy.org/db/app/sfs">https://www.digitalepigraphy.org/db/app/sfs</a></p>
<p>The new on-line tool utilizes cloud technology to store, process, and disseminate the results of the 3D reconstruction algorithm. It allows the users to upload pictures of a flat inscribed object (such as epigraphic squeeze, paper embossment, seal, inscriptions, casts of coins, and others), taken from the same perspective using 2 or 4 different lighting conditions.</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://research.dwi.ufl.edu/op.n/file/2fzrs3i2cvas964f/embed" width="1200px" height="600px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>With the permission of the British Museum, an interdisciplinary team from the University of Florida and the University of Leipzig scanned the Rosetta Stone in June 2018 to generate a high-resolution 2D and 3D map of its inscribed surface. In our setup, we used a single DSLR camera (Nikon D3400), which was fixed on a tripod in front of the stone, and calibrated as follows: exposure time = 5 sec., ISO speed = ISO-100, F-stop = f/25, focal length = 135mm, and max aperture = 4.5. To reconstruct the tridimensional inscribed surface using the shape-from-shading method, we controlled the lighting of the stone using a handheld light wand (Ice Light) that served as a 15-inch long light source of 1600 lumen at 5600k color temperature.</p>
<p>We divided the artifact in 8 regions (4 rows and 2 columns), which were photographed individually at 6000 x 4000 pixel resolution. Each region was photographed in 4 different lighting directions (light from the left, top, right, bottom) by placing the light wand in the corresponding side of the region of interest. This quadri-directional lighting configuration allowed us to capture information related to the local orientation at each point of the surface through the differences of the light reflection observed in the corresponding four photographs. The entire scanning session, including opening the glass case of the artifact, setting up the equipment, digitizing the artifact, and putting everything in its original configuration before the opening of the museum took us 120 min.</p>
<p>During this time 32 photographs were taken in total (8 regions x 4 lighting conditions), which were then processed to compose high-resolution 2D and 3D representations of the surface with 0.08141mm sampling frequency, which is equivalent to 312 DPI resolution. The tridimensional details of the inscribed surface were captured in the depth map, which was computed by processing the four corresponding images of the same region of interest illuminated with four different lighting orientations using the method by A. Barmpoutis, E. Bozia, and R. Wagman published in the Journal of Machine Vision and Applications 21(6) in 2010. The depth map contains detailed three-dimensional information of the inscribed surface so that it can be visualized in 3D. The 3D reconstructed surface can be rendered as an interactive 3D model that can be manipulated by the user (move, scale, rotate) and can be inspected under different virtual lighting orientations and shading methods.</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to the 3D reconstruction of the inscribed surface, we used a hand-held laser scanner (Structure Sensor by Occipital) mounted on a tablet computer (iPad Air by Apple) in order to create a 3D model of the entire stone. Although the 3D model generated by this scanner can depict the overall shape of the entire artifact, it does not have enough resolution to capture the fine details of the inscribed surface. Therefore, the 3D reconstructed surface using shape-from-shading is complementary to the laser-scanned 3D model, as both of these forms can co-exist in order to depict different structural details of the artifact.</p>
<p>The result of this process is a high resolution 3D representation of the Rosetta Stone that is available on-line as an interactive web app and can be accessed through the project&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>In November 2019, the project was featured in German news outlets: <a href="https://www.mdr.de/wissen/stein-von-rosette-digital-leipzig-100.html">https://www.mdr.de/wissen/stein-von-rosette-digital-leipzig-100.html</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GAINESVILLE, Fla.<br />
June 3, 2015.</p>
<p>An interdisciplinary team from the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology group at the University of Florida and the Aleshire Center for the Study of Greek Epigraphy at the University of California, Berkeley digitized in 3D squeezes (paper casts) of inscriptions from the Aleshire collection. The goal of this pilot project was to stretch the shape-from-shading (SFS) method<sup><a href="#ref1"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1</span></a></sup> of the Digital Epigraphy Toolbox<sup><a href="#ref2"><span style="color: #0000ff;">2</span></a></sup> to its limits by testing it to severely weathered inscriptions from Thebes and Sifnos.</p>
<p>SFS has been successfully used in the past by our group for 3D digitization of inscriptions from the <a href="http://www.digitalepigraphy.org/news/inscriptions_teletransferred_and_printed_in_3d/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Monumentum Ancyranum</span></a> (in collaboration with Cornell University), <a href="http://www.digitalepigraphy.org/news/the_national_archives_3d_digitization_project/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">seals and medals</span></a> (in collaboration with the UK National Archives), <a href="http://www.digitalepigraphy.org/news/tracing_the_papers_of_abraham_lincoln/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">paper embossments from Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s letters</span></a> (in collaboration with the Library of Congress and Cornell University) and most recently <a href="http://www.digitalepigraphy.org/news/the_estampages_3d_digitization_project_of_greek_inscriptions/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">inscriptions from Delphi, Thasos, and Delos</span></a> (in collaboration with the University of Lyon 2 and the French School of Athens).</p>
<p>The question to be answered in this pilot project was: Can SFS assist epigraphists in reading severely weathered inscriptions by intensifying the inscribed symbols or even reveal new fragments?</p>
<p>To find the answer to this question, Prof. Nikolaos Papazarkadas and John Lanier (UC Berkeley) selected three sample squeezes with hard-to-read inscribed fragments and scanned them, using a regular flatbed scanner (Expression 10000XL by EPSON). Each fragment was scanned four times by rotating the squeeze 90 degrees each time, according to the SFS process<sup><a href="#ref1"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1</span></a></sup>. An example of the obtained results is shown in the figures below.</p>

<span class="nrml"><b>Figure 2.</b> Different visualizations of the depthmap from Fig.1(right) that intensify different details of the 3D reconstructed model. Left: Color inverted depthmap. Right: Histogram equalized depthmap.</span></center>By comparing the original scanned image (Fig.1 left) with the depthmap of the 3D reconstructed inscription shown in the figures above, it is evident that the 3D digital model is significantly richer in information. According to Prof. Barmpoutis (University of Florida) &#8220;this is an exemplar case that demonstrates the capabilities of 3D digitized models compared to the original 2D images. It is truly remarkable how much more inscribed details can be seen in the depthmap computed by the SFS method, using just a conventional office paper scanner. When I first saw the scanned squeeze I was convinced that there was no inscription survived in this fragment, but when I saw the reconstruction results I could clearly recognize several letters despite the fact that I am not a professional epigraphist myself.&#8221;</p>

<span class="nrml"><b>Figure 3.</b> Left: One of the original scanned images of a squeeze from a severely weathered inscription. Right: The 3D reconstructed depthmap computed by the SFS method from the Digital Epigraphy Toolbox.</span></center>According to professional epigraphists from UC Berkeley who inspected the reconstructed data &#8220;the biggest difference is that it takes several hours in the museum in order to read what it can be read, while with the digitized squeeze it can be done conveniently at home&#8221;. They also noted that &#8220;the difference between SFS and RTI is obviously the cost&#8221; and &#8220;what was most impressive was the depthtmap, which is very useful and can be used for publication.&#8221;</p>

<span class="nrml">This figure shows selected samples from our dataset of 3D digitized statues.</span></center>Digital technologies have been adopted in various areas related to museum experience, digital preservation, as well as digitization and study of archaeological artifacts. Digital collections become even more useful educationally and scientifically when they provide tools for searching through the collection and analyzing, comparing, and studying their records. For example an image collection becomes powerful if it can be searched by content, technique, pattern, color, or even similarity with a sample image. The lack of keywords and generalizable annotation for such type of analysis generates the need for keyword-free feature-based analysis.</p>

<span class="nrml">Visualization of the estimated skeletons of statues in our dataset shown from three different perspectives. Quantitative posture analysis can be applied to such dataset in order to assist scholars in studying the variations between sculptures from different cultures, eras, and schools.</span></center>The DEA group has designed a framework in which each statue is represented in a feature space based on the skeletal geometry of the human body. A distance function is defined in the feature space and is employed in order to find statues with similarities in their pose. The search query in the presented framework is the body of the user, who can interact with the system and find which statues have poses similar to the user&#8217;s pose. The framework will be presented in the 17th International Confrence on Human-Computer Interaction to be held in Los Angeles, in August 2015.</p>

The future use of depth sensors in mobile devices will significantly support the creation of such repositories of 3D digitized artifacts, using limited resources (in terms of scanning time, computational effort, and cost) as well as their computer-assisted study as demonstrated in detail in the published article by Barmpoutis et al<sup><a href="#ref2"><span style="color: #0000ff;">2</span></a></sup>.</p>

October 15, 2014.</p>
<p>A collaborative team from Université Lyon 2, Maison de l&#8217;Orient et de la Méditerranée, the French School of Athens (École française d’Athènes), and the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology group at the University of Florida have received a grant award from the French Ministry of Higher Education under the grant program BSN5 2014 <sup><a href="#ref1"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1</span></a></sup>.This collaborative project titled &#8220;e-stampages&#8221; is lead by Prof. Michèle Brunet and is aiming to digitize and disseminate electronically the large collection of ektypa (estampages in French) of inscriptions from Delphi, Thasos, Delos, Crete, Aetolia, Chalcidice, Asia Minor, Boeotia, and Homole<sup><a href="#ref2"><span style="color: #0000ff;">2</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>The awarded amount of €53,500 will cover the digitization costs of nearly 8000 casts of inscriptions and is expected to be completed by June 2016. The database that will be created will contain 2D and 3D digitized records of the entire collection as well as metadata entries regarding the original inscriptions.</p>
<p>During last summer, the team performed a series of pilot 3D digitization experiments at the University of Lyon in order to establish an efficient process that can be followed in such a large scale digitization project. In this pilot study selected paper casts of inscriptions were digitized using the shape-from-shading framework<sup><a href="#ref3"><span style="color: #0000ff;">3</span></a></sup> of the Digital Epigraphy Toolbox.</p>

<p>Have you wondered how ancient Greek and Latin inscriptions may relate to Abraham Lincoln?</p>
<p>Conservation experts, digital collection specialists, digital epigraphy scholars and computer scientists from the University of Florida, Cornell University and the Library of Congress have digitized in 3D historical documents of Abraham Lincoln. More specifically, the Cornell University&#8217;s copy of Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s Gettysburg Address has an embossed anaglyph on the top left of the front page of the document<sup><a href="#ref1"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1</span></a></sup>.<br />
A similar embossment can also be found on a letter from T. D. Eliot to Abraham Lincoln dated on February 1, 1864, currently located in the manuscript division of the Library of Congress.</p>

<span class="nrml">Two examples of 3D digitized seals of Henry III King of England (left) and the coat of arms of Kiel (right).</span></center>The artifacts were digitized in sub-millimeter accuracy using bi-directional flatbed scanning<sup><a href="#ref2"><span style="color: #0000ff;">2</span></a></sup>. This cost-effective technique reconstructs the tri-dimensional shape of the scanned objects using a regular flatbed office scanner.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this digitization project we experimented in digitizing materials with various reflectance properties. We were very happy to see that high quality 3D scans were acquired from a variety of materials such as paper, plaster and lace&#8221; according to Prof. Barmpoutis, who is the director of the Digital Epigraphy and Archeology project. Dr. Dinah Eastop and Rachel Farmer from The National Archives [UK] performed the bi-directional scanning of the artifacts, which were then processed and digitized in 3D by the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology group (Drs. Bozia, Wagman, and Barmpoutis) at the University of Florida.</p>
