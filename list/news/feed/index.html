<span class="nrml"><b>Figure 1.</b> Photo from the grand opening of the virtual exhibition of dragons and lions at the University of Florida.</span></center>This virtual exhibition introduced the new natural user interface of the DEA Virtual Museum, which allows the users to interact with the 3D artifacts, using natural motions and gestures. The DEA Virtual Museum of World Heritage made its <a href="http://www.digitalepigraphy.org/news/virtual_museum_opens_in_london_digital_classicist_seminar/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">debut in 2013 in London</span></a> and has been expanding its public 3D collections since then. The new interface is open-source and provides integration of several popular forms of natural user interaction, such as touch screens (in hand-held devices or laptops), VR displays (Oculus Rift head-mounted display, Samsung Gear VR and Google cardboard), accelerometer (in tablets and smartphones) in addition to the traditional touch pad, mouse and keyboard interaction.</p>

Humanities Insights, the NEH blog for Congressional Staff, featured on March 18, 2014 the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology project. Part of the project, specifically the Digital Epigraphy Toolbox, was previously funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and was recently completed and released for public use.

The article states that “Since its creation, the toolbox has been presented at national and international conferences, such as the 104th American Institute of Archaeology Annual Meeting and the 13th Congress of Greek and Latin Epigraphy hosted by Oxford University. In 2012 it placed second in an international competition for an eHumanities Digital Innovation Award; the competition was hosted by the University of Leipzig in Germany. The National Archives [UK] used the toolbox to digitize 13th-16th century artifacts in its collection. More recently, the DEA group teamed up with Cornell University and the Library of Congress to digitize historical documents written by President Lincoln, including the Gettysburg Address.”

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GAINESVILLE, Fla.<br />
September 6, 2013.</p>
<p>Here is a challenge: An archaeologist in Europe wants to share an important ancient inscription with a colleague in a north American university. It would be nice if she can teletransfer the inscription so that her colleague can receive it as a tridimentional tangible physical object so it can be studied better.</p>
<p>An interdisciplinary team from the University of Florida and the Cornell University successfully achieved the first tele-transferring of 3D inscriptions between their institutions and printing in 3D of the transmitted artifacts. This is an important step towards the electronic dissemination of tri-dimensional epigraphic material to the academic community as it facilitates the study of ancient inscriptions, according to the Associate Director Dr. Eleni Bozia, who led this experiment.</p>

<span class="nrml">A close photograph of a 3D printed sample of one of the reconstructed ancient inscriptions with the latin word <i>QVA</i>.

<p>Dr. Eric Rebillard (Classics and History, Cornell University) and Dr. Ben Anderson (History of Art, Cornell University) with Rhea Garen (Institute for Digital Collections, Cornell University) scanned a set of ancient inscriptions, which were transferred through this novel pipeline to the University of Florida, where the Digital Epigraphy group Dr. Eleni Bozia (Classics, University of Florida), Dr. Robert Wagman (Classics, University of Florida) and Dr. Angelos Barmpoutis (Digital Worlds Institute, University of Florida) reconstructed in 3D the original object and printed a tri-dimensional copy of the tele-transferred inscription.</p>
<p>This experiment was performed on a set of squeezes of the <i>Res Gestae</i> made on the Monumentum Ancyranum in 1907. According to Prof. Rebillard &#8220;this collection of squeezes is a very valuable testimony to the inscription that had much suffered since and it even has the potential of being a better testimony than the Mommsen casts upon which all modern editions are based.&#8221;</p>

<span class="nrml">Dr. Eleni Bozia lecturing at the University of London, Digital Classicist Seminar, 2013.</span></center>The Virtual Museum offers a web interface for browsing the 3D digitized inscriptions and archaeological artifacts from the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology database. The database was developed as part of the <a href="https://www.digitalepigraphy.org/legacy/toolbox"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Digital Epigraphy Toolbox</span></a><sup><a href="#ref2"><span style="color: #0000ff;">2</span></a></sup>, a software funded by the <a href="https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=HD-51214-11"><span style="color: #0000ff;">National Endowment for the Humanities</span></a> for digitizing and disseminating inscriptions in their tri-dimensional form.</p>
<p>The goal of the Virtual Museum interface is to facilitate the digital preservation and dissemination of important historical tri-dimensional artifacts in a form easily accessible from the web-browser of a personal computer, or other electronic devices, such as tablets and smart phones. Furthermore, the 3D exhibits can be easily <a href="https://research.dwi.ufl.edu/projects/digitalepigraphy.org/page/embed-3d-archaeological-artifacts-into-your-website-or-database/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">embedded</span></a> into other web-sites, databases, or digital platforms, such as interactive digital books.</p>

June 3, 2013.</p>
<p>The Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology group is proud to present the first HTML5 embeddable 3D epigraphic viewer. You can now easily embed the 3D objects of the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology database into your own web-site, blog, or personal database, using this embeddable viewer. Each virtual exhibit has an HTML tag that can be found in the archaeological record of the exhibit (see image below).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-72" src="https://research.dwi.ufl.edu/projects/digitalepigraphy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/embed-300x119.png" alt="" width="300" height="119" srcset="https://www.digitalepigraphy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/embed-300x119.png 300w, https://www.digitalepigraphy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/embed-600x238.png 600w, https://www.digitalepigraphy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/embed.png 695w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>You can copy and paste the corresponding tag into your web-site at a location and size of your choice. The viewer is based on the new canvas capabilities of HTML5 and <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl"><span style="color: #0000ff;">webGL</span></a><sup><a href="#ref1"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1</span></a></sup>, which can render 3D content on websites. There is no need to download additional plugins to use these technologies, since they are already included in the majority of the popular desktop and mobile web-browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>The main advantage of this viewer is that it can be easily embedded into websites by using the following HTML tag:<br />
<textarea style="width: 635px;" readonly="readonly">&lt;iframe src=&#8221;https://www.digitalepigraphy.org/legacy/&lt;span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;view?heightmap=d1a7a25fdaf3010f&#8221; width=&#8221;600px&#8221; height=&#8221;400px&#8221;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</textarea></p>
<p>The width and height can be customized according to the design of your website by changing the corresponding parameters in the above HTML tag. Multiple objects can be added to the same website by using this tag with the corresponding identification number of the archaeological artifact from the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology database, which can be accessed using the interface of the <a href="https://www.digitalepigraphy.org/legacy/museum/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">DEA Virtual Museum of World Heritage</span></a>, or the <a href="https://www.digitalepigraphy.org/legacy/toolbox/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Digital Epigraphy Toolbox</span></a><sup><a href="#ref2"><span style="color: #0000ff;">2</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>This is an example of a 3D digitized artifact embedded in this website using the above HTML tag.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.digitalepigraphy.org/legacy/view?heightmap=d1a7a25fdaf3010f" width="600px" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Move your mouse over the above viewer in order to interact with its features. You can move, rotate, zoom, and relight the exhibit by clicking on the proper icon and dragging your mouse over the inscription. Other options include 2D visualization of the heightmap of the inscription as well as full screen mode of the viewer.</p>
<p>You can easily create your own database of 3D inscriptions by digitizing your squeezes in 3D using a regular flatbed office scanner and our 3D digitization algorithm (Barmpoutis, Bozia, and Wagman, <i>Machine Vision and Applications</i>, 2010)<sup><a href="#ref3"><span style="color: #0000ff;">3</span></a></sup>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This easy-to-embed viewer facilitates the interoperability of various epigraphic and archaeological projects and is a big step towards the unification of digital epigraphic databases.&amp;quot, according to Dr. Bozia, Associate Director of the DEA project.</p>
<p>Our team supports Open-Source Programming as a form of academic collaboration, and we provide the source code of this viewer, which can be easily accessed using the Developer Tools of your browser.</p>
<p>For questions or other inquiries please do not hesitate to contact us, using our contact details at <a href="https://www.digitalepigraphy.org"><span style="color: #0000ff;">www.digitalepigraphy.org</span></a> or our Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/digitalepigraphy/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">www.facebook.com/groups/digitalepigraphy/</span></a>.</p>

The University of Florida College of Fine Arts and Digital Worlds Institute has been awarded $50,000 by the National Endowment for the Humanities Office of Digital Humanities. The award will fund the Digital Epigraphy Toolbox project, a collaborative research initiative between the Digital Worlds Institute and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences department of classics. The project is led and coordinated by Digital Worlds Institute professor Angelos Barmpoutis. This project is an open source, cross-platform web application designed to facilitate the digital preservation, study and electronic dissemination of ancient inscriptions. It allows epigraphists to digitize in 3-D their epigraphic squeezes using a novel cost-effective technique, which overcomes the limitations of the current methods for digitizing epigraphic data in 2-D only.]]></description>

<p>The University of Florida College of Fine Arts and Digital Worlds Institute has been awarded $50,000 by the National Endowment for the Humanities Office of Digital Humanities.</p>
<p>The award will fund the Digital Epigraphy Toolbox project, a collaborative research initiative between the Digital Worlds Institute and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences department of classics.</p>
<p>The project is led and coordinated by Digital Worlds Institute professor Angelos Barmpoutis. This project is an open source, cross-platform web application designed to facilitate the digital preservation, study and electronic dissemination of ancient inscriptions. It allows epigraphists to digitize in 3-D their epigraphic squeezes using a novel cost-effective technique, which overcomes the limitations of the current methods for digitizing epigraphic data in 2-D only.</p>
<p>The proposed toolbox contains several options for 3-D visualization of inscriptions as well as a set of scientific tools for analyzing the lettering techniques and performing quantitative analysis of the letterform variations. Furthermore, the users have the option to share their data as well as to search for other uploaded collections of 3-D inscriptions in a semi-supervised dynamic library.</p>
<p>This dynamic library is organized thematically according to language, area of origin, and date and will contain a comprehensive record of the inscription in the form of plain text, 3-D model, 2-D photographs, and other epigraphic information.</p>
<p>The award will fund the project for the next two years.</p>
