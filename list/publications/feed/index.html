										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past decade, archaeology and epigraphy have been reconsidering their modus operandi. Prompted and facilitated by technological advances, motivated by new research questions, and challenged by growing calls to engage with contemporary audiences, they have been experimenting with methodological approaches and interdisciplinary collaborations. Within this context, the Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology project (DEA) has been developing 3D digitization techniques that accommodate various types of artifacts, has been incorporating multidisciplinary approaches to achieve a more holistic stance towards the objects of study, and has focused on the reproducibility and accessibility of both its techniques and the 3D models.</p>
<p>This paper presents the DEA’s introspective and reembodied ways of preserving and studying the past by reconsidering historical artifacts and their digital re-materialization. The following sections discuss the project’s approach to copies and digital copies, 3D digitization and enhanced visualization processes, comprehensive cloud services, and 3D printing to present the DEA steps toward facilitating and advancing archaeology and epigraphy. Through such approaches that combine traditional rigor with technological novelty and affordances, the team’s vision is to popularize archaeology and epigraphy within and beyond academia and pinpoint the significance of the world’s heritage to the new generations of students and the public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Cabinet-CIS is known for publishing two monumental series through the late nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries, the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum and the Répertoire d’épigraphie sémitique. Those compiling these works were sent paper mâché squeezes of the inscriptions in those volumes and in some cases photographs along with detailed descriptions. The collection holds an estimated 10,000+ paper mâché squeezes of Semitic inscriptions from the Near East, North Africa, and the Mediterranean. In some cases these squeezes are of inscriptions which are now lost or inaccessible (due to their location in politically contested regions). Additionally, the collection holds hundreds of original objects and dozens of dossiers of many of the field’s most important figures, such as that of Charles Clermont-Ganneau. Unfortunately, the collection is only loosely organized into boxes and cupboards, for which a short inventory had been compiled.</p>
<p>The database includes record entries where all necessary information about an object in the collection can be stored, including metadata, text, and translation. Each entry includes mapping a timeline features for the object along with additional media storage that can be linked to the object.</p>
<p>The ultimate objective was to initiate the process of digital preservation of the squeezes and other artifacts. To achieve this, I solicited the support of Angelos Barmpoutis of the Digital Worlds Institute and Eleni Bozia of the Classics Department at the University of Florida, whose <a href="https://www.digitalepigraphy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source Digital Epigraphy software</a> proved to be an ideal application for our needs. By using scans from a flatbed scanner or raking light photographs one can easily render 3D scans of the squeezes. An example of AIBL-CIS Dos. 12.01.01 “Inscription royale d’Idalion” (446 BCE = RÉS 453; squeeze made in 1887) can be found <a href="https://www.digitalepigraphy.org/db/file/dll2k76zoq399m4h/embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Manipulating the photograph using the Digital Epigraphy’s user interface produces the best known available photograph of the inscription.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book by the British Museum was published to accompany the exhibition Hieroglyphs: Unlocking Ancient Egypt at the British Museum from October 13, 2022 &#8211; February 19, 2023. Published to coincide with the bicentenary of Jean-François Champollion’s breakthrough in decipherment, this beautifully illustrated book shows how an unassuming gray stone was the key to the secrets of ancient Egypt and led to one of the most significant code breaking moments in history.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 of the book is titled &#8220;New Approaches&#8221; and features the Digital Rosetta Stone project (pages 236-241). The book includes a photograph of our digitization session in June 2018 that led to the 3D digitization of the Rosetta Stone and the capturing of the depth map of the inscription.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year 2017 is a turning point for many disciplines as within the past year new technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality, have been established as low-cost and easy-to-use consumer devices. The potential advantages were eloquently predicted by Bodel et al. in the paper titled “Epigraphy in 2017”: What we hope will change and improve by 2017 are the tools available for gathering information and analyzing it…”</p>
<p>In this work we present a method for a novel interface for studying inscriptions, using augmented reality head-mounted displays, such as Microsoft’s Hololens glasses. This interface allows the users to browse through 3D databases of inscriptions and visualize the inscription within their actual physical space, such as office or classroom. Once the user positions the hologram of the inscription in a particular location, as the top of the desk, it remains there, allowing him/her to move around the inscription and study the artifact as a whole, up close, and from different perspectives. Similarly multiple inscriptions can be positioned next to one another, providing the opportunity for comparative readings, profound study of lettering techniques, and potential identification and pairing of fragments.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge this is the first project that utilizes this kind of holographic technology, opening for the first time the possibilities to epigraphists to conveniently study the inscriptions in a more natural way as physical objects instead of viewing the artifacts simply as 3D files on a desktop computer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Le programme E-STAMPAGES réunit dans une publication numérique deux des plus riches collections d’estampages d’inscriptions grecques, celle de l’École française d’Athènes et celle du laboratoire HiSoMA, « Histoire et sources des mondes antiques », liées par une même histoire institutionnelle. En s’appuyant sur une numérisation en mode image et sur une structuration de l’information adéquate, le programme conjoint deux objectifs : un archivage à long terme des estampages sous une forme dématérialisée et la mise à disposition en libre accès sur internet d’un ensemble d’environ 12 000 documents, actuellement uniquement accessibles à qui se déplace à Lyon ou à Athènes pour les consulter.</p>
<p>En tant qu’empreinte de l’inscription, un estampage papier est naturellement un objet en trois dimensions. Dans la transposition dans un environnement numérique, il nous a semblé impératif de tenir le plus grand compte de cette caractéristique essentielle afin de préserver la « gestuelle de l’épigraphiste », qui manipule l’estampage papier en faisant varier un éclairage frisant sur les reliefs moulés des lettres pour en faciliter le déchiffrement par un ombrage différentiel. Il nous est en effet apparu que les tentatives antérieures de valorisation par le numérique de collections d’estampages par la diffusion de seules photographies 2D n’ont pas toujours été convaincantes, précisément parce que cette qualité de l’estampage, objet papier en relief, avait été négligée ou n’avait pas pu être transposée, la technique de création d’images virtuelles en 3D n’existant pas encore. C’est pourquoi nous avons adopté le protocole développé par nos collègues du Digital Epigraphy and Archeology project de l’Université de Floride, qui propose une méthode de traitement simple et efficace, aboutissant à une visualisation des estampages tenant compte de ces caractéristiques grâce à un outil de reconstruction du relief (Barmpoutis et al. 2010). Ce procédé se fonde sur la double numérisation de l’estampage à haute résolution en variant l’angle d’exposition à la lumière de 90°, puis sur une modélisation de la silhouette de l’inscription à partir de la confrontation des ombres portées sur les deux images. L’estampage peut ainsi être manipulé à l’écran, ce qui permet l’observation sous différents angles de vues des lettres gravées avec une variation de l’ombrage ; les gestes et les usages de l’épigraphiste sont transposés, la 3D lui offrant des conditions de lecture équivalentes, voire meilleures, à celles dont il bénéficie habituellement.</p>

A skeletal model is fitted to the depth image of a statue or human body in general and is used as a feature vector that captures the pose variations in a given collection of skeleton data. A scale- and twist- invariant distance function is defined in the feature space and is employed in a topology-preserving low-dimensional lattice mapping framework. The user can interact with this self-organizing map by submitting queries in the form of a skeleton from a statue or a human body. The proposed methods are demonstrated in a real dataset of 3D digitized Graeco-Roman statues from Palazzo Altemps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology Project (DEA) is a unique initiative in the field of digital epigraphy as it provides the methods to digitize in 3D squeezes (ektypa, Abklatsch, estampages), plaster casts of coins and seals, lace, and paper embossments, using cost-effective 3D reconstruction technique that utilizes images taken by regular office scanners. The Digital Epigraphy Toolbox is a web application that focuses on the digitisation, 3D visualisation, data mining, and electronic dissemination of such artefacts. Also, it offers several visualisation modules, thus facilitating the electronic dissemination and study of historically important artefacts. A current phase of the project involves the digitisation of Latin inscriptions from Rome, Spain, North Africa, and Eastern Mediterranean from the CIL collection. Latin inscriptions are of inestimable value as sources for the study of Roman life and history in all its aspects. As a direct legacy of the ancient world, they are &#8220;speaking&#8221; evidence of a past culture whose enduring influence has shaped Europe. As such they provide a reliable guide through the rubble of archaeological remains and are often our first means of placing ancient monuments in their everyday context. From early Rome – although firstly in significant numbers from the time of Augustus – right through the imperial period to the sixth century AD, Latin inscriptions are a constant feature of the thousand-year history of the city of Rome, its provinces and people; as a widely used medium they reflect communication within that society in all its facets. Most of the existing databases only provide access to textual information assembled from previous printed editions or still photographs – a fact that limits the potential for original research, as the scholar is reduced to studying the information from someone else’s perspective. The DEA is not only meant to be another database that also includes alternative visual representations; its goal is to use those state-of-the-art technologies so that the researchers may study the text and lettering technique of the inscriptions anew, having access to the 3D model of squeeze and being able to visually manipulate it. Finally, it is not feasible to conduct manual study and examine the lettering techniques of hundreds of squeezes in a reasonable amount of time without automatic computer-assisted techniques. The Digital Epigraphy team develops methods for the automatic segmentation of letters of each inscription and automatic grouping. This module is meant to present the affinities between all the letters in the form of dendrograms, effectuating automatic comparison of hundreds of inscriptions in a manner of seconds. The purpose of this process will be to give the researcher the opportunity to date, identify pieces of broken inscriptions, and perform numerous additional analyses that up to now require incalculable work hours, if they are at all possible in some cases. When contested fragments are housed in different institutions, if their digital copies exist online, it will be a unique opportunity to be identified and paired.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article explores one application of a digital imaging technique to historic objects and online delivery of the virtual object. Shape-from-shading is a computer algorithm used to reconstruct three-dimensional shapes from two-dimensional images. The Digital Epigraphy and Archaeology (DEA) project used shape-from-shading to develop a digital website and toolbox to enhance computer-assisted examination of inscriptions preserved as ektypa. This article reports the results of a project to see if the DEA website and toolbox could be used with other materials and objects with information-rich textured surfaces. Seventeen samples were tested, including lace-like textiles placed on different backing materials; wax seal impressions made from a range of materials; and excavated metals. It was found that image capture with a flatbed scanner achieved better results than a multi-functional printer, and that the unprocessed flatbed scan images were sometimes more informative than digital photographs. It was possible to modify the DEA algorithm for both the lace-like samples and the seal impressions to obtain good three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed images. However, this was not possible with the metal samples due to the nature of the material. The 3D reconstructed images are useful to online users in providing an interactive resource that can be manipulated by the user, rather than a two-dimensional (2D) image.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Preservation and dissemination of archaeological material has always been an issue of concern for the academic research community. On the one hand, the fragility of the material limits their study. On the other hand, such material is housed in museums, libraries, and institutions worldwide, something that significantly thwarts their accessibility. Technology, high resolution 2D pictures, and electronic databases have attempted to overcome the aforementioned limitations. However, lack of contact with the physical object as a tridimensional structure still significantly obstructs research. In this paper we present the latest advances of the Digital Epigraphy Toolbox, a novel project that focuses on the digitization in 3D of ancient inscriptions from ektypa, the multi-modal visualization of their 3D models, the facilitation of interlinked 3D digitized records, and the easy and effective electronic dissemination of archaeological material. This project offers options for cost-effective shape-from-shading 3D digitization of ektypa, using a flatbed scanner, and various visualization modes, such as photorealistic 3D views and informative fingerprint map and depth map that assist scholars understand the structural characteristics of the artifacts. Finally, the project facilitates the dissemination of the 3D digitized objects by providing the users with an embeddable 3D viewer which can be easily imported in third-party databases, collections, and personal websites.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Studying ancient inscriptions is based up to date mostly on observation and manual analysis by means of which epigraphists attempt to establish a geographical and chronological classification as well as to analyze the lettering techniques. In this paper we propose a novel framework for efficient 3D reconstruction of inscriptions and for statistical analysis of their reconstructed surfaces.</p>

<p>The proposed framework employs a shape-from-shading technique to reconstruct in 3D the shape of the inscribed surfaces. The obtained surfaces are segmented into smaller box-shaped regions containing single letters. These letters are classified into groups of same characters or symbols and then an atlas (average) letter shape is created for each character. For the construction of those atlases we employ a functional minimization method that registers the surfaces of same letters to the unknown average surface, which is also estimated simultaneously. Using the estimated atlases an automated analysis of the inscribed letters is performed. This framework can be effectively used for the study of the variations of the lettering techniques within an inscription or a set of inscriptions. We applied our framework to five ancient Greek inscriptions. Our results are reported in detail and the variations found in lettering techniques are commented on by archaeologists who also validate the accuracy of our proposed method.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this paper we propose a novel method for 3D reconstruction of inscriptions using a shape-from-shading technique and for statistical analysis of their reconstructed surfaces using images of scanned squeezes. The squeeze is scanned twice from two different directions. Using the shading information a 3D model of the original surface is reconstructed and parametrized as a height map. This map is automatically segmented into smaller regions containing single letters, which are divided into groups of same characters and are further employed for a statistical analysis of the inscribed letters. The results can be used for studying the variations of the lettering techniques within a set of inscriptions.</p>

<p>We have applied our framework to five inscribed fragments from the archaeological site of Epidauros, containing religious hymns for Asclepius and other deities (IG IV I 2, 129-135; SEG 30, 390 = Robert Wagman, Inni di Epidauro, 1995). Although found in different locations, these inscriptions show close affinities in content (sacred poetry), material (red local limestone) and writing (uncial lettering of the third century CE). The 3D reconstruction of the letterforms provides us with definite proof that all of them came from the same monument, possibly an inscribed wall from one of the buildings in the sanctuary&#8217;s main area. A closer observation of the results reveals even some minor groups of letters with similar construction, which validates the accuracy of the proposed method. The advantages of 3D reconstruction in epigraphical research are especially obvious in the case of badly weathered or damaged inscribed surfaces, where the lettering is difficult to discern with the naked eye.</p>
